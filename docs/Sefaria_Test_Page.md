  The Sefaria test page now includes:

  1. Advanced Hebrew Text Matching: Intelligent alignment between pre-segmented Sefaria text and continuous HebrewBooks text
  2. Linguistic Boundary Detection: Uses Hebrew/Aramaic word patterns (endings, prepositions, punctuation) to find natural segment boundaries
  3. Gap-Filling Algorithm: Automatically fills unmatched segments with text that falls between successfully matched segments
  4. Three-Column Layout: Shows Sefaria Hebrew, English translation, and matched HebrewBooks text side-by-side
  5. Quality Scoring: Color-coded similarity scores (excellent/good/fair/poor) for each match
  6. Generalized Patterns: Uses universal linguistic patterns instead of hard-coded words for scalability across 2000+ pages
  7. Backtracking Support: Fixes overlapping segments when one segment consumes text from the next
  8. Visual Feedback: Clear indicators for match quality and debugging tools

  The implementation is now ready to handle the complex task of aligning Talmudic text across different sources while maintaining accuracy and providing clear feedback about match
  quality.
